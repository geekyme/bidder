Hotel Room Bidder POC
====
This repository of code demonstrates a POC idea for a pricing project in Singapore Management University (MKTG 313 Pricing). It is made to investigate the effects of dynamic room pricing in hotel rooms specially presented in the format of room bidding. The end goal of this POC is to prove that existing hotel rooms can be offered at a low price for price-sensitive consumers but yet retain (or exceed) prior profit margins using a cost per bid model. 

The software is created with MeteorJS and also demonstrates how to use MeteorJS to create a simple web application in 30 minutes.
